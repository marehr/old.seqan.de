abstract = {High-throughput DNA sequencing has considerably changed the possibilities for conducting biomedical research by measuring billions of short DNA or RNA fragments. A central computational problem, and for many applications a first step, consists of determining where the fragments came from in the original genome. In this article, we review the main techniques for generating the fragments, the main applications, and the main algorithmic ideas for computing a solution to the read alignment problem. In addition, we describe pitfalls and difficulties connected to determining the correct positions of reads.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Large insertions of novel sequence are an important type of structural variants. Previous studies used traditional de novo assemblers for assembling non-mapping high-throughput sequencing (HTS) or capillary reads and then tried to anchor them in the reference using paired read information.

RESULTS:We present approaches for detecting insertion breakpoints and targeted assembly of large insertions from HTS paired data: BASIL and ANISE. On near identity repeats that are hard for assemblers, ANISE employs a repeat resolution step. This results in far better reconstructions than obtained by the compared methods. On simulated data, we found our insert assembler to be competitive with the de novo assemblers ABYSS and SGA while yielding already anchored inserted sequence as opposed to unanchored contigs as from ABYSS/SGA. On real-world data, we detected novel sequence in a human individual and thoroughly validated the assembled sequence. ANISE was found to be superior to the competing tool MindTheGap on both simulated and real-world data.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:ANISE and BASIL are available for download at http://www.seqan.de/projects/herbarium under a permissive open source license.},

abstract = {The present study was performed in an attempt to develop an in vitro integrated testing strategy (ITS) to evaluate drug-induced neurotoxicity. A number of endpoints were analyzed using two complementary brain cell culture models and an in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model after single and repeated exposure treatments with selected drugs that covered the major biological, pharmacological and neuro-toxicological responses. Furthermore, four drugs (diazepam, cyclosporine A, chlorpromazine and amiodarone) were tested more in depth as representatives of different classes of neurotoxicants, inducing toxicity through different pathways of toxicity. The developed in vitro BBB model allowed detection of toxic effects at the level of BBB and evaluation of drug transport through the barrier for predicting free brain concentrations of the studied drugs. The measurement of neuronal electrical activity was found to be a sensitive tool to predict the neuroactivity and neurotoxicity of drugs after acute exposure. The histotypic 3D re-aggregating brain cell cultures, containing all brain cell types, were found to be well suited for OMICs analyses after both acute and long term treatment. The obtained data suggest that an in vitro ITS based on the information obtained from BBB studies and combined with metabolomics, proteomics and neuronal electrical activity measurements performed in stable in vitro neuronal cell culture systems, has high potential to improve current in vitro drug-induced neurotoxicity evaluation.},
