abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Diabetes like many diseases and biological processes is not mono-causal. On the one hand multi-factorial studies with complex experimental design are required for its comprehensive analysis. On the other hand, the data from these studies often include a substantial amount of redundancy such as proteins that are typically represented by a multitude of peptides. Coping simultaneously with both complexities (experimental and technological) makes data analysis a challenge for Bioinformatics. RESULTS: We present a comprehensive work-flow tailored for analyzing complex data including data from multi-factorial studies. The developed approach aims at revealing effects caused by a distinct combination of experimental factors, in our case genotype and diet. Applying the developed work-flow to the analysis of an established polygenic mouse model for diet-induced type 2 diabetes, we found peptides with significant fold changes exclusively for the combination of a particular strain and diet. Exploitation of redundancy enables the visualization of peptide correlation and provides a natural way of feature selection for classification and prediction. Classification based on the features selected using our approach performs similar to classifications based on more complex feature selection methods. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of ANOVA and redundancy exploitation allows for identification of biomarker candidates in multi-dimensional MALDI-TOF MS profiling studies with complex experimental design. With respect to feature selection our method provides a fast and intuitive alternative to global optimization strategies with comparable performance. The method is implemented in R and the scripts are available by contacting the corresponding author.},

abstract = {Peptide sequencing from mass spectrometry data is a key step in proteome research. Especially de novo sequencing, the identification of a peptide from its spectrum alone, is still a challenge even for state-of-the-art algorithmic approaches. In this paper we present Antilope, a new fast and flexible approach based on mathematical programming. It builds on the spectrum graph model and works with a variety of scoring schemes. Antilope combines Lagrangian relaxation for solving an integer linear programming formulation with an adaptation of Yen's k shortest paths algorithm. It shows a significant improvement in running time compared to mixed integer optimization and performs at the same speed like other state-of-the-art tools. We also implemented a generic probabilistic scoring scheme that can be trained automatically for a dataset of annotated spectra and is independent of the mass spectrometer type. Evaluations on benchmark data show that Antilope is competitive to the popular state-of-the-art programs PepNovo and NovoHMM both in terms of run time and accuracy. Furthermore, it offers increased flexibility in the number of considered ion types. Antilope will be freely available as part of the open source proteomics library OpenMS.},

abstract = {Proteomics experiments based on state-of-the-art mass spectrometry produce vast amounts of data, which cannot be analyzed manually. Hence, software is needed which is able to analyze the data in an automated fashion. The need for robust and reusable software tools triggered the development of libraries implementing different algorithms for the various analysis steps. OpenMS is such a software library and provides a wealth of data structures and algorithms for the analysis of mass spectrometric data. For users unfamiliar with programming, TOPP ("The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline") offers a wide range of already implemented tools sharing the same interface and designed for a specific analysis task each. TOPP thus makes the sophisticated algorithms of OpenMS accessible to nonprogrammers. The individual TOPP tools can be strung together into pipelines for analyzing mass spectrometry-based experiments starting from the raw output of the mass spectrometer. These analysis pipelines can be constructed using a graphical editor. Even complex analytical workflows can thus be analyzed with ease.},

abstract = {Second generation sequencing technologies yield DNA sequence data at ultra high-throughput. Common to most biological applications is a mapping of the reads to an almost identical or highly similar reference genome. The assessment of the quality of read mapping results is not straightforward and has not been formalized so far. Hence, it has not been easy to compare different read mapping approaches in a unified way and to determine which program is the best for what task.We present a new benchmark method, called Rabema (Read Alignment BEnchMArk), for read mappers. It consists of a strict definition of the read mapping problem and of tools to evaluate the result of arbitrary read mappers supporting the SAM output format.We show the usefulness of the benchmark program by performing a comparison of popular read mappers. The tools supporting the benchmark are licensed under the GPL and available from http://www.seqan.de/projects/rabema.html.},
