abstract = {The discovery of functional non-coding RNA sequences has led to an increasing interest in algorithms related to RNA analysis. Traditional sequence alignment algorithms, however, fail at computing reliable alignments of low-homology RNA sequences. The spatial conformation of RNA sequences largely determines their function, and therefore RNA alignment algorithms have to take structural information into account.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and combined with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) have become a prominent tool for the analysis of complex proteomic samples. An important step in a typical workflow is the combination of results from multiple LC-MS experiments to improve confidence in the obtained measurements or to compare results from different samples. To do so, a suitable mapping or alignment between the data sets needs to be estimated. The alignment has to correct for variations in mass and elution time which are present in all mass spectrometry experiments.

RESULTS:We propose a novel algorithm to align LC-MS samples and to match corresponding ion species across samples. Our algorithm matches landmark signals between two data sets using a geometric technique based on pose clustering. Variations in mass and retention time are corrected by an affine dewarping function estimated from matched landmarks. We use the pairwise dewarping in an algorithm for aligning multiple samples. We show that our pose clustering approach is fast and reliable as compared to previous approaches. It is robust in the presence of noise and able to accurately align samples with only few common ion species. In addition, we can easily handle different kinds of LC-MS data and adopt our algorithm to new mass spectrometry technologies.

AVAILABILITY:This algorithm is implemented as part of the OpenMS software library for shotgun proteomics and available under the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL) at www.openms.de.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Experimental techniques in proteomics have seen rapid development over the last few years. Volume and complexity of the data have both been growing at a similar rate. Accordingly, data management and analysis are one of the major challenges in proteomics. Flexible algorithms are required to handle changing experimental setups and to assist in developing and validating new methods. In order to facilitate these studies, it would be desirable to have a flexible 'toolbox' of versatile and user-friendly applications allowing for rapid construction of computational workflows in proteomics.

RESULTS:We describe a set of tools for proteomics data analysis-TOPP, The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline. TOPP provides a set of computational tools which can be easily combined into analysis pipelines even by non-experts and can be used in proteomics workflows. These applications range from useful utilities (file format conversion, peak picking) over wrapper applications for known applications (e.g. Mascot) to completely new algorithmic techniques for data reduction and data analysis. We anticipate that TOPP will greatly facilitate rapid prototyping of proteomics data evaluation pipelines. As such, we describe the basic concepts and the current abilities of TOPP and illustrate these concepts in the context of two example applications: the identification of peptides from a raw dataset through database search and the complex analysis of a standard addition experiment for the absolute quantitation of biomarkers. The latter example demonstrates TOPP's ability to construct flexible analysis pipelines in support of complex experimental setups.

AVAILABILITY:The TOPP components are available as open-source software under the lesser GNU public license (LGPL). Source code is available from the project website at www.OpenMS.de},
