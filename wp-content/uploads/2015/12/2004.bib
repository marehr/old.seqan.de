abstract = {MOTIVATION:Besides their prevalent use for analyzing gene expression, microarrays are an efficient tool for biological, medical and industrial applications due to their ability to assess the presence or absence of biological agents, the targets, in a sample. Given a collection of genetic sequences of targets one faces the challenge of finding short oligonucleotides, the probes, which allow detection of targets in a sample. Each hybridization experiment determines whether the probe binds to its corresponding sequence in the target. Depending on the problem, the experiments are conducted using either unique or non-unique probes and usually assume that only one target is present in the sample. The problem at hand is to compute a design, i.e. a minimal set of probes that allows to infer the targets in the sample from the result of the hybridization experiment. If we allow to test for more than one target in the sample, the design of the probe set becomes difficult in the case of non-unique probes.

RESULTS:Building upon previous work on group testing for microarrays, we describe the first approach to select a minimal probe set for the case of non-unique probes in the presence of a small number of multiple targets in the sample. The approach is based on an ILP formulation and a branch-and-cut algorithm. Our preliminary implementation greatly reduces the number of probes needed while preserving the decoding capabilities.

abstract = {We report a whole-genome shotgun assembly (called WGSA) of the human genome generated at Celera in 2001. The Celera-generated shotgun data set consisted of 27 million sequencing reads organized in pairs by virtue of end-sequencing 2-kbp, 10-kbp, and 50-kbp inserts from shotgun clone libraries. The quality-trimmed reads covered the genome 5.3 times, and the inserts from which pairs of reads were obtained covered the genome 39 times. With the nearly complete human DNA sequence [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Build 34] now available, it is possible to directly assess the quality, accuracy, and completeness of WGSA and of the first reconstructions of the human genome reported in two landmark papers in February 2001 [Venter, J. C., Adams, M. D., Myers, E. W., Li, P. W., Mural, R. J., Sutton, G. G., Smith, H. O., Yandell, M., Evans, C. A., Holt, R. A., et al. (2001) Science 291, 1304-1351; International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium (2001) Nature 409, 860-921]. The analysis of WGSA shows 97% order and orientation agreement with NCBI Build 34, where most of the 3% of sequence out of order is due to scaffold placement problems as opposed to assembly errors within the scaffolds themselves. In addition, WGSA fills some of the remaining gaps in NCBI Build 34. The early genome sequences all covered about the same amount of the genome, but they did so in different ways. The Celera results provide more order and orientation, and the consortium sequence provides better coverage of exact and nearly exact repeats.},
