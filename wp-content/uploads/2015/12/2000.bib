abstract = {MOTIVATION:Multiple sequence alignment is an important tool in computational biology. In order to solve the task of computing multiple alignments in affordable time, the most commonly used multiple alignment methods have to use heuristics. Nevertheless, the computation of optimal multiple alignments is important in its own right, and it provides a means of evaluating heuristic approaches or serves as a subprocedure of heuristic alignment methods.

RESULTS:We present an algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer alignment approach together with recent results on search space reduction to speed up the computation of multiple sequence alignments. The method is adaptive in that depending on the time one wants to spend on the alignment, a better, up to optimal alignment can be obtained. To speed up the computation in the optimal alignment step, we apply the alpha(*) algorithm which leads to a procedure provably more efficient than previous exact algorithms. We also describe our implementation of the algorithm and present results showing the effectiveness and limitations of the procedure.},

abstract = {We report on the quality of a whole-genome assembly of Drosophila melanogaster and the nature of the computer algorithms that accomplished it. Three independent external data sources essentially agree with and support the assembly's sequence and ordering of contigs across the euchromatic portion of the genome. In addition, there are isolated contigs that we believe represent nonrepetitive pockets within the heterochromatin of the centromeres. Comparison with a previously sequenced 2.9- megabase region indicates that sequencing accuracy within nonrepetitive segments is greater than 99. 99% without manual curation. As such, this initial reconstruction of the Drosophila sequence should be of substantial value to the scientific community.},

abstract = {The fly Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most intensively studied organisms in biology and serves as a model system for the investigation of many developmental and cellular processes common to higher eukaryotes, including humans. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of nearly all of the approximately 120-megabase euchromatic portion of the Drosophila genome using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy supported by extensive clone-based sequence and a high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome physical map. Efforts are under way to close the remaining gaps; however, the sequence is of sufficient accuracy and contiguity to be declared substantially complete and to support an initial analysis of genome structure and preliminary gene annotation and interpretation. The genome encodes approximately 13,600 genes, somewhat fewer than the smaller Caenorhabditis elegans genome, but with comparable functional diversity.},

abstract = {Multiple alignment is an important problem in computational biology. It is well known that it can be solved exactly by a dynamic programming algorithm which in turn can be interpreted as a shortest path computation in a directed acyclic graph. The A* algorithm (or goal-directed unidirectional search) is a technique that speeds up the computation of a shortest path by transforming the edge lengths without losing the optimality of the shortest path. We implemented the A* algorithm in a computer program similar to MSA (Gupta et al., 1995) and FMA (Shibuya and Imai, 1997). We incorporated in this program new bounding strategies for both lower and upper bounds and show that the A* algorithm, together with our improvements, can speed up computations considerably. Additionally, we show that the A* algorithm together with a standard bounding technique is superior to the well-known Carrillo-Lipman bounding since it excludes more nodes from consideration.},
