abstract = {The reconstruction of the history of evolutionary genome-wide events among a set of related organisms is of great biological interest since it can help to reveal the genomic basis of phenotypes. The sequencing of whole genomes faciliates the study of gene families that vary in size through duplication and loss events, like transfer RNA. However, a high sequence similarity often does not allow one to distinguish between orthologs and paralogs. Previous methods have addressed this difficulty by taking into account flanking regions of members of a family independently. We go one step further by inferring the order of genes of (a set of) families for ancestral genomes by considering the order of these genes on sequenced genomes. We present a novel branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the two species small phylogeny problem in the evolutionary model of duplications and losses. On average, our implementation, DupLoCut, improves the running time of a recently proposed method in the experiments on six Vibrionaceae lineages by a factor of âˆ¼200. Besides the mere improvement in running time, the efficiency of our approach allows us to extend our model from cherries of a species tree, that is, subtrees with two leaves, to the median of three species setting. Being able to determine the median of three species is of key importance to one of the most common approaches to ancestral reconstruction, and our experiments show that its repeated computation considerably reduces the number of duplications and losses along the tree both on simulated instances comprising 128 leaves and a set of Bacillus genomes. Furthermore, in our simulations we show that a reduction in cost goes hand in hand with an improvement of the predicted ancestral genomes. Finally, we prove that the small phylogeny problem in the duplication-loss model is NP-complete already for two species.},

abstract = {The increasing scale and complexity of quantitative proteomics studies complicate subsequent analysis of the acquired data. Untargeted label-free quantification, based either on feature intensities or on spectral counting, is a method that scales particularly well with respect to the number of samples. It is thus an excellent alternative to labeling techniques. In order to profit from this scalability, however, data analysis has to cope with large amounts of data, process them automatically, and do a thorough statistical analysis in order to achieve reliable results. We review the state of the art with respect to computational tools for label-free quantification in untargeted proteomics. The two fundamental approaches are feature-based quantification, relying on the summed-up mass spectrometric intensity of peptides, and spectral counting, which relies on the number of MS/MS spectra acquired for a certain protein. We review the current algorithmic approaches underlying some widely used software packages and briefly discuss the statistical strategies for analyzing the data.},

abstract = {A reaction scheme was derived for the thermal degradation of thyroxine in the solid state, using data obtained from ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). To study the reaction mechanism and kinetics of the thermal degradation of the pharmaceutical in the solid state, a workflow was developed by generating compound-specific, time-dependent degradation or formation curves of at least 13 different degradation products. Such curves allowed one to distinguish between first- and second-generation degradation products, as well as impurities resulting from chemical synthesis. The structures of the degradation products were derived from accurate molecular masses and multistage mass spectrometry. Deiodination and oxidative side chain degradation were found to be the major degradation reactions, resulting in the formation of deiodinated thyroxines, as well as acetic acid, benzoic acid, formaldehyde, acetamide, hydroxyacetic acid, oxoacetic acid, hydroxyacetamide, or oxoacetamide derivatives of thyroxine or deiodinated thyroxine. Upon additional structural verification of mass spectrometric data using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, this comprehensive body of data sheds light on an elaborate, radical-driven reaction scheme, explaining the presence or formation of impurities in thermally stressed thyroxine.},

abstract = {We present Masai, a read mapper representing the state-of-the-art in terms of speed and accuracy. Our tool is an order of magnitude faster than RazerS 3 and mrFAST, 2-4 times faster and more accurate than Bowtie 2 and BWA. The novelties of our read mapper are filtration with approximate seeds and a method for multiple backtracking. Approximate seeds, compared with exact seeds, increase filtration specificity while preserving sensitivity. Multiple backtracking amortizes the cost of searching a large set of seeds by taking advantage of the repetitiveness of next-generation sequencing data. Combined together, these two methods significantly speed up approximate search on genomic data sets. Masai is implemented in C++ using the SeqAn library. The source code is distributed under the BSD license and binaries for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows can be freely downloaded from https://www.seqan.de/projects/masai.},
