abstract = {High-throughput DNA sequencing has considerably changed the possibilities for conducting biomedical research by measuring billions of short DNA or RNA fragments. A central computational problem, and for many applications a first step, consists of determining where the fragments came from in the original genome. In this article, we review the main techniques for generating the fragments, the main applications, and the main algorithmic ideas for computing a solution to the read alignment problem. In addition, we describe pitfalls and difficulties connected to determining the correct positions of reads.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Large insertions of novel sequence are an important type of structural variants. Previous studies used traditional de novo assemblers for assembling non-mapping high-throughput sequencing (HTS) or capillary reads and then tried to anchor them in the reference using paired read information.

RESULTS:We present approaches for detecting insertion breakpoints and targeted assembly of large insertions from HTS paired data: BASIL and ANISE. On near identity repeats that are hard for assemblers, ANISE employs a repeat resolution step. This results in far better reconstructions than obtained by the compared methods. On simulated data, we found our insert assembler to be competitive with the de novo assemblers ABYSS and SGA while yielding already anchored inserted sequence as opposed to unanchored contigs as from ABYSS/SGA. On real-world data, we detected novel sequence in a human individual and thoroughly validated the assembled sequence. ANISE was found to be superior to the competing tool MindTheGap on both simulated and real-world data.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:ANISE and BASIL are available for download at https://www.seqan.de/projects/herbarium under a permissive open source license.},
