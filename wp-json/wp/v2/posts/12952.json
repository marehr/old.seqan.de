This release has been in the making for roughly half a year now and we are proud to present some great new features and also a lot of improvements  with respect to run time and usability. You can find a comprehensive list of the changes in our <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.seqan.de\/seqan\/3.0.1\/about_changelog.html#autotoc_md198\">changelog<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Get to know SeqAn3 with our <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.seqan.de\/seqan\/3-master-user\/usergroup1.html\">tutorials<\/a>.<\/li><li>Visit our <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.seqan.de\/seqan\/3.0.1\/index.html\">API documentation<\/a>.<\/li><li>See the <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.seqan.de\/seqan\/3-master-user\/howto_porting.html\">porting guide<\/a> for some help on porting from SeqAn2.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that 3.1.0 will be the first API stable release and interfaces in this release might still change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>\ud83c\udf89 Notable new features<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>\nWe added support for type erasing <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.seqan.de\/seqan\/3.0.1\/interfaceseqan3_1_1semialphabet.html\">semialphabets<\/a>\n that allows you to manage semialphabets with the same alphabet size in \none container. This can have a big effect on your compile-time, in case \nyou don&#8217;t drink as much \u2615\ufe0f as we do.\n<\/li><li>\nWe added parallel support for the alignment algorithm. You can now \nconfigure the number of threads you want to use for the alignment \ncomputation.\nClick for an example \n\n\n<\/li><li>\nOne to command them all: Our argument parser now supports <strong>subcommands<\/strong>, such as <code>git pull<\/code>. A <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.seqan.de\/seqan\/3.0.1\/subcommand_arg_parse.html\">How-to<\/a> will guide you through setting this up for your tool.\n<\/li><li>\nThe performance of the <strong>I\/O was improved<\/strong> to allow faster file reading. Further, we added support for reading and writing the CIGAR string through alignment files.\n<\/li><li>\nWe added several new ranges and views. Most notably, the <code>seqan3::views::kmer_hash<\/code> view, which transforms a sequence into a range of k-mer hashes efficiently. Another view of great practice is the <code>seqan3::views::to<\/code>, which can be used to convert a view into a container. We also added a <code>seqan3::dynamic_bitset<\/code> which is a dynamic version of the <code>std::bitset<\/code>.\n<\/li><li>\nMemory consumption of the (bidirectional) FM-Index for text collections was reduced by 10%.\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Notable API changes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as we&#8217;d like to reduce inconsistencies between releases, we \nare sometimes forced to change an interface either to improve usability \nor to follow changes made by the ISO C++ committee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>All our concepts are named in the <code>snake_case<\/code> style (e.g. <code>seqan3::WritableAlphabet<\/code> -&gt; <code>seqan3::writable_alphabet<\/code>)!<\/li><li>The directory <code>seqan3\/range\/view<\/code> has been renamed to <code>seqan3\/range\/view<strong>s<\/strong><\/code>.<\/li><li>The namespace <code>seqan3::view<\/code> has been renamed to <code>seqan3::view<strong>s<\/strong><\/code>.<\/li><li>The CMake variable <code>SEQAN3_VERSION_STRING<\/code> defined by <code>find_package(SEQAN3)<\/code> was renamed to <code>SEQAN3_VERSION<\/code>.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find a comprehensive list of the changes in our <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.seqan.de\/seqan\/3.0.1\/about_changelog.html#autotoc_md198\">changelog<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>\ud83d\udc1b Notable bug fixes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Copying and moving the <code>seqan3::fm_index<\/code> and <code>seqan3::bi_fm_index<\/code> now work properly.<\/li><li>The translation table for nucleotide to amino acid translation was corrected.<\/li><li>The amino acid score matrices were corrected.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>\ud83d\udd0c External dependencies<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>We now support ranges-v3 versions &gt;= 0.10.0 and &lt; 0.11.0, \nincreasing the previous requirement of &gt;= 0.5.0 and &lt; 0.6.0.<\/li><li>We now support cereal version 1.3.0, increasing the previous requirement of 1.2.2<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"Feedback\">\u270d\ufe0f Feedback<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We would love to hear what you think about the features.
